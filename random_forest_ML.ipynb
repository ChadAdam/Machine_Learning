    "The data we are importing is stored in a PostgreSQL database. This data is the review posts on yelp ranging from April 2005 till January 2013. Each post is identified by a review id. Each review id has a corrisponding user id for the user who posted it and business id for the business being posted about. Each post includes the cool , useful , and funny votes given by the community members. \n",

    "First we need to connect and retrieve this data from the database. We can import psycopg2 which is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python used to interegrate Python with PostgreSQL. We use it to connect to my personal database namd script on the local machine. Now we can execute commands to the database. We will do this using pandas to query for the table business and return the results in dataframe. A dataframe is essentially a data object in Python that allows manipulating of data in table form, with columns and rows. Let's first test it to see what the table looks like:"

To get rid of them we will skip a Python solution all together and just select only the columns that aren't the columns mentioned using SQL. Now we will take the Dataframe returned and remove the first row and any extra data that is a side affect of our Python operations. We are leeft with a Dataframe with 6 columns and 10000 rows. None of those rows include Null and all of the columns are of datatype Object. "

    "When we combine our analysis of the number of businesses a user reviews with how the number of stars are distributed with we might learn something interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The ratio of unique values for star is 0.000600 , for texts is 0.999800 , for business id is 0.417458 , and user id is 0.640336. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In regard to the amount of businesses each user reviews the Max is 38 , the Min is 1 , the Mean is 1.561680199875078 , and the Median is 1.0. For our purposes the mean and median are both 1. The 25th percentile is 1.000000 , the 50th percentile is 1.000000 , 75th percentile 1.000000. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In regard to the amount of stars given for a review the mean is 3.777500 , min is 1.000000 , 25th percentile is 3.000000, median is 4.000000, 75th percentile is 5.000000 , max is 5.000000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of the stars has a increase in amount of stars given from the min of 1 star to the median of 4 stars and then a decrease for the remaining value of 5 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the bid is around 41.7% unique that means it is around 59.3% values that repeat at least once. If the uid is 64% unique that means it is 36% values that repeat at least once. When we combine the 59.3% not unique businesses with the 64% unique users we gain some insight. Every user must have at least one business reviewed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Which means if we assume bid and uid barely overlap (as much unique users review as much unique businesses as possible), then still 22.3% of unique users would have reviewed a business that is already reviewed by someone else. If we assume bid and uid overlap as much as possible(as much unique users review as little unique businesses possible), then 4.7% of of unique users would review an unique business. This means 95.3% of unique users would have reviewed a business that is already reviewed by someone else. This means the min percentage of users who reviewed more than one allowed is 22.3% and the max is 95.3%.\n",
    "\n",
    "However , this can not be true. We know that the 75th percentile is still 1. Which means 75% of the businesses that are reviewed are less than or equal to 1. So by default 75% of the range of businesses that are reviewed per user must be at max 1. The true range now is the top 22.3% to 25%. Another way of looking at it is all values between 1st to 75th percentile must be 1 since the min is 1 and the possible value series greater than 1 can start anywhere between the 75th percentile to the 77 percentile. Either way a series roughly equal to the top 22% of the data is always greater than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most reviews are positively skewed with a median of 4 stars. 50% of all reviews are reviews that are 4 stars or less. =The bottom 25% ( up to the 25th percentile) are reviews that are 3 stars or less. From 25th percentile to 50th =percentile the reviews could be 3 stars or 4 stars. From the 50th percentile to the 75th percentile the reviews could =be 4 stars or 5 stars. And the top 25%( 75th percentile to max) must be 5 stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these two datasets tells us that if the top 50% of reviews can only be 4 stars or 5 stars and 75% of the unique users( which are a subset of all user reviews) reviewed only 1 business, then unless the duplicate user reviews operate under a very different review pattern we can say that users who review only 1 business choose a variety of different stars for the reviews. It is not correct to say a user who reviews 1 business has number of stars they will trend toward."

    "### Analyzing cool , funny, useful ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can plot the features cool , funny and useful we have a problem. We would prefer if all these ratings were consistent in what they mean, and in a form friendly to graphing. But how should we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this by turning numeric values into a scheme of low , mid , high. Low will start at 25% of the range , mid will start at 50% of the range and high will start at 75% of the range. In the past we used percentiles to navThigate from the min to the max. This was because we needed to take into account the frequency of each value. Now we don't. We only care about the distance between the min value and max value. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had a series of values [ 0, 75,75,75,100] , the 50th percentile is 75. However the middle distance the min 1 and the max 100 is 50. Let's double check by using the formula ((n-min)/(max-min))*100. (50-0)/(100-0)=.5 *100 = 50%\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance does not care how many times a value is shown , it only needs the min and max to determine the percentage. This is what we want since low , mid , and high are just the range seperated into parts. To be exact will will make the bottom 25% of the range low and the top 25% high. The remaining will become mid. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example we knew what the value we wanted was and through the calculations we found the percentage. To get our values we have to change the formula to assume the percentage to calculate the values we will use to divide the range. The new equation is S=1/100(P*max+100*min−P*min) \n",
